## Vision 🎯

Sonic OS aims to create a completely new operating system kernel written in **Rust**, with:  
- **Memory safety** without garbage collection.  
- **Modern modular design** for scalability and performance.  
- **An original file system** unlike any existing solution.  
- **Opportunities for learning and collaboration** while maintaining a unique vision.

## Modular Project Structure 🛠️

The project is divided into independent modules:  

1. **Kernel Core** – Booting, interrupts, initialization.  
2. **Memory Management** – RAM handling, allocation, virtual memory.  
3. **Task Scheduler** – Process/thread management and execution control.  
4. **File System Core** – Original storage and metadata design.  
5. **Drivers / I/O** – Communication with virtual or physical devices.

> Each module is designed to be **as independent as possible** while communicating through clear interfaces.

## Version Control & Collaboration 🌐

- Each contributor works on their **own branch**.  
- When a module is ready:  
  - Submit a **Pull Request** to the `main branch`.  
  - Reviewed by the team for compatibility.  
- All code must include comments and documentation for smooth integration.

---

## Interfaces & Protocols 🔗

- Clear agreements on **how modules interact**:  
  - Memory module provides storage info to File System.  
  - Scheduler communicates with drivers for process execution.  
- This allows contributors to work independently without needing the full system ready.

---

## Integration & Testing 🧪

- After modules are ready:  
  - Build the **full kernel + file system + drivers**.  
  - Test on **QEMU or other emulators** before any hardware.  
- Debugging is easier because each module is separate and testable individually.

---

## Documentation 📚

- Each contributor documents their module and how it interacts with the rest of the system.  
- Any API changes are recorded immediately.  
- Ensures **conflict-free integration** and smooth project progression.

---

## Iteration & Improvement 🔄

- After successful integration:  
  - Test system performance and stability.  
  - Gradually add new features: file system improvements, I/O support, kernel enhancements.  
- Iterative development moves the project toward a **complete, powerful, and revolutionary OS** while keeping contributors motivated.

## How to Contribute 🤝

Even though Sonic OS is in **concept stage**, contributors can:  
- Experiment with Rust `no_std` bare-metal programming.  
- Build independent modules or propose new features.  
- Discuss improvements or design ideas.

> Note: Contributors own the code they write. Sonic OS is your platform to create something **unique and groundbreaking**.

---

💡 **Goal:**  
- Sonic OS will be a modular, fully integrated kernel with an original file system.  
- Each contributor feels their work matters.  
- Even if contributors change, the integration plan ensures the system remains **cohesive and revolutionary**.

“Pick any module, experiment, and create history!”
